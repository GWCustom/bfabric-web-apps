# bfabric_web_apps Documentation

A Python-based library designed for the development and integration of satellite applications with the B-Fabric Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS).

---

## Overview

Designed to work seamlessly with [Dash](https://dash.plotly.com/), **bfabric_web_apps** simplifies the creation of web applications that interact with B-Fabric. Built on a **template-based approach**, it standardizes common patterns, streamlines development, and provides a modular foundation for extending the B-Fabric Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) with satellite applications.



### Key Features

- **Simplified B-Fabric Integration**  
  - **Token Data Management** – Securely handle authentication tokens for API access.  
  - **Entity Data Handling** – Retrieve, modify, and update B-Fabric entities dynamically.  
  - **Logger** – Integrated logging for API calls, application events, and errors.  

- **Custom Dashboards**  
  Create **interactive and dynamic dashboards** using Dash and Plotly to visualize and manage your data.

- **Layouts and UI Components**  
  Leverage **boilerplate and template Dash components, layouts, and callbacks** to streamline development, maintain consistent design, and accelerate the creation of user-friendly interfaces.

## Get Started Quickly

Developers can hit the ground running with the **[bfabric_web_app_template](https://github.com/GWCustom/bfabric-web-app-template)**, a **ready-made** project that demonstrates how to configure and deploy a `bfabric_web_apps` application end-to-end. It includes:

- **Preconfigured layout** using Dash and Bootstrap.  
- **Authentication flow** for B-Fabric.  
- **Examples** of logging, API interaction, and entity handling.

By combining the **template** with the **bfabric_web_apps** library, you’ll have a **flexible**, **scalable** starting point for **building custom web apps** that tap into B-Fabric’s powerful capabilities.

## What Is B-Fabric?

B-Fabric is a Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) developed for managing scientific experiments and their associated data. It offers a robust platform to track samples, analyze results, and organize workflows efficiently for researchers, laboratories, and core facilities.

For more information, visit the [Bfabric official website](https://fgcz-bfabric.uzh.ch/bfabric/).

## What Is BfabricPy?

**BfabricPy** is a Python library that serves as a programmatic interface to interact with the B-Fabric API. It enables developers to perform operations such as querying data, uploading results, and managing B-Fabric entities seamlessly from Python-based applications.

BfabricPy is a core dependency of **bfabric_web_apps** and powers API connections for building custom applications.

For more information, visit the [BfabricPy GitHub repository](https://github.com/fgcz/bfabricPy/tree/main).
