# Nextflow Use Case

This chapter provides a comprehensive example of how Nextflow-based workflows, specifically NF-Core RNA-seq, can be seamlessly integrated into web applications using the `bfabric_web_apps` library.

---

## Overview

This chapter demonstrates how the `bfabric_web_apps` library can be utilized to build Dash-based applications for running Nextflow pipelines. The general structure of these applications leverages Redis queues for asynchronous job management, integrates seamlessly with the B-Fabric system, and employs a modular, user-friendly web interface for workflow management.

The RNA-seq application described in detail here is a proof-of-concept showcasing how complex bioinformatics workflows can be efficiently executed through an interactive web interface integrated into the B-Fabric ecosystem. For the complete source code or a quickstart guide, visit the [RNA-seq app GitHub repository](https://github.com/GWCustom/rnaseq).

Additionally, although not covered extensively in this chapter, we provide two other proof-of-concept applications:

* **Demultiplex App**: Demonstrates integration between B-Fabric, the NF-Core Demultiplex pipeline, and Redis-based asynchronous job execution, validating the flexibility of the `bfabric_web_apps` library. The source code is available in the [bfabric\_app\_demultiplex GitHub repository](https://github.com/GWCustom/bfabric_app_demultiplex).

* **Hello World App**: Offers a minimalistic example to quickly grasp the basic integration concepts between Nextflow, B-Fabric, and Redis job queues. The source code is available in the [nfc-hello-world GitHub repository](https://github.com/GWCustom/nfc-hello-world).

### What is Nextflow & NF-Core?

[**Nextflow**](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/index.html) is a powerful workflow management system designed for scalable, reproducible computational pipelines. It supports parallel and distributed computing across various environments, including local machines, HPC clusters, and cloud services.

[**NF-Core**](https://nf-co.re/) is a community-driven project that provides standardized Nextflow pipelines adhering to best practices for bioinformatics analysis. It includes workflows for a wide range of use cases, such as RNA-seq, ATAC-seq, and genome assembly.

## RNA-seq Use Case

The RNA-seq app illustrates the practical application of the `bfabric_web_apps` library by orchestrating the widely-used NF-Core RNA-seq pipeline for bulk transcriptomics analysis.

The RNA-seq app is a **proof-of-concept application** for transcriptomic analysis within the B-Fabric ecosystem. It demonstrates how to combine B-Fabric metadata, a user-friendly Dash interface, and NF-Core RNA-seq pipelines in a single web application.

The app is built using the `bfabric_web_apps` library and follows the [`redis_index.py`](https://github.com/GWCustom/bfabric-web-app-template) template, enabling asynchronous job execution via a Redis queue system.

Although this chapter specifically discusses the RNA-seq use case, many elements and structures described here are common across other Nextflow-based applications. The RNA-seq app thus serves as a representative example to illustrate the general structure and implementation patterns of Nextflow applications developed using the `bfabric_web_apps` library.

### NF-Core RNA-seq Pipeline

The NF-Core RNA-seq pipeline is a widely used, community-maintained workflow for processing bulk RNA sequencing data. It includes quality control, alignment, quantification, and differential expression analysis using tools such as FastQC, STAR, and DESeq2.

For more details, see the [official documentation](https://nf-co.re/rnaseq/3.18.0/).

### App Structure

The RNA-seq app is organized into three main components:

1. **B-Fabric Integration**
   Internal logic handles all interactions with the B-Fabric API. It fetches project and dataset metadata, extracts relevant information, and generates sample sheet files used as pipeline input.

2. **User Interface**
   The Dash-based UI collects key input parameters such as CPU, RAM, FASTA, GTF files, and an email address. It also includes a **Charge Switch** to associate run costs with a B-Fabric container. Sample metadata is visualized in a table where users can review and edit records before submission.

3. **Main Job Execution**
   When the user confirms submission, the app:

   * Converts files to byte streams.
   * Builds the appropriate bash command to run the Nextflow-based NF-Core RNA-seq pipeline.
   * Enqueues the job to Redis for remote execution.
   * Registers output files and reports back into B-Fabric via the API.

This modular design supports rapid development and easy adaptation to other Nextflow pipelines.

---

### Server Architecture

The RNA-seq app follows a **three-tier architecture** that decouples the web interface, job scheduling, and job execution:

* A **Web App Server** hosts the Dash UI, processes input from users, fetches B-Fabric metadata, and enqueues jobs via Redis.
* A **Compute Server** listens to Redis, runs the actual Nextflow jobs using `run_main_job()`, and stores output locally.
* The **B-Fabric System** provides metadata access and receives resource links and attachments once processing is complete.

This architecture allows for **asynchronous**, **scalable**, and **user-friendly** execution of complex workflows integrated with B-Fabric.

### Step-by-Step Workflow

1. **Launch the App**
   The user opens the RNA-seq web app via a B-Fabric launch link containing a valid session token.

2. **Authentication and Token Validation**
   The app extracts the token, validates it using B-Fabric’s REST API, and fetches:

   * Token metadata
   * Application metadata
   * Dataset/entity metadata

3. **Configure Run Parameters**
   The user enters details like:

   * Job name and comment
   * Email address
   * Number of CPUs and RAM allocation
   * FASTA and GTF reference files
   * Queue selection (`light` or `heavy`)
   * Toggle charge switch (on/off)

4. **Review Sample Metadata**
   A DataTable renders the B-Fabric dataset. Users can inspect and review the detected sample names and file associations.

5. **Submit the Pipeline Job**
   After clicking the submit button, a modal asks for final confirmation.

6. **Run the Job via Redis Queue**
   On confirmation:

   * A sample sheet CSV is generated and saved
   * Associated files are converted to byte strings
   * Bash commands for pipeline execution are prepared
   * Output/attachment/resource paths are configured
   * The job is enqueued using Redis (`q(queue).enqueue(...)`)

7. **Charge Project (Optional)**
   If the Charge Switch is enabled, the selected container is charged using the `create_charge()` function before pipeline execution.

---

### Expected Output

Once the job is completed, users can expect the following:

* **Output Directory on Compute Server**:
  A directory structure containing all pipeline outputs, logs, and reports. Named based on timestamp, e.g., `/STORAGE/OUTPUT_rnaseq_2025-05-06_10-32-00`

* **Registered B-Fabric Resources**:
  The output directory and key attachments (e.g., MultiQC reports, Qualimap reports, DESeq2 plots) are linked back to the originating dataset entity in B-Fabric.

* **Accessible QC Reports**:
  HTML reports and plots are attached to the dataset for downstream inspection or publication.

* **Workunit Creation**:
  The application logs workunits for job tracking and reproducibility within B-Fabric. This functionality is handled automatically through the `bfabric_web_apps` library configuration.

* **Automatic Charging (if enabled)**:
  If the user activates the Charge Switch, the application automatically charges the appropriate container using the configured service ID before pipeline execution.

* **Integrated Metadata**:
  All generated outputs—datasets, resources, and workunits—are fully connected within B-Fabric, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and integration across the platform.

By following this structured approach, users can run RNA-seq pipelines reproducibly, monitor job progress, and trace results directly within B-Fabric—all from an interactive and simplified Dash web interface.
