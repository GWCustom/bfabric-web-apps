## Use Case Overview

The following two chapters present real-world examples of how the `bfabric_web_apps` framework has been used to build production-ready applications for bioinformatics at FGCZ. Each use case demonstrates how the modular architecture and reusable components of the framework enable rapid development of web-based tools that integrate seamlessly with the B-Fabric ecosystem.

* The **[RNA-seq use case](rna_seq_use_case.md)** illustrates how to run an NF-Core pipeline through a Dash interface with integrated job scheduling and metadata registration.
* The **[Sushi use case](sushi_use_case.md)** highlights a suite of apps that allow users to configure and launch analysis jobs via the Sushi runner backend.

These examples showcase both the frontend user interaction layer and the backend compute orchestration enabled by the framework.
