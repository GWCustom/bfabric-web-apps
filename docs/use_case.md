## Use Case Overview

The following chapters present proof-of-concept examples demonstrating how the `bfabric_web_apps` framework can be used to build real-life applications. Each use case illustrates how the modular architecture and reusable components of the framework support the rapid development of web-based tools that integrate with the B-Fabric ecosystem.

```{note}
**Work in Progress**  
The following use case chapters are currently under construction and not yet complete. Content will be added and refined continuously to better showcase real-world applications of the `bfabric_web_apps` framework.
```

* The **[RNA-seq use case](rna_seq_use_case.md)** shows how to run an nf-core RNA-seq pipeline through a Dash interface, featuring integrated job submission, parameter configuration, and metadata registration.
* The **[Demultiplex use case](demultiplex_use_case.md)** demonstrates a web app for running the nf-core demultiplexing pipeline (BCL to FASTQ), providing an accessible interface for job submission and status tracking.
* The **[Sushi use case](sushi_use_case.md)** presents an application wrapper for launching modular Sushi apps via B-Fabric, enabling flexible job configuration and execution through the Sushi backend.

These examples highlight the frameworkâ€™s capabilities in both frontend user interaction and backend data management, serving as prototypes for future applications.
